The licensing is layered GPLv3/Modified-BSD and GPLv3/GPLv2

Note, this project is essentially a fork of the albatross project from gitorious,
with changes merged in from Hugo Vincent's Github fork.

	1.	Description
_______________________________________________________________________________

OpenGC is part of the groundstation software for the Albatross UAV project.
OpenGC was originally authored by Damion Shelton for use by flight simulator
enthusiasts in 2001-2004, and has been substantially modified and improved to
suit realtime monitoring of autonomous aircraft from the ground.
