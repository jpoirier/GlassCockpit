	Preamble
_______________________________________________________________________________

The original OpenGC was created by Damian Shelton (damion at opengc.org) at
www.opengc.org and forked at www.gitorious.org/albatross/albatross/ and again 
forked at www.github.com/hugovincent/GlassCockpit.

The original project and the fork at www.gitorious.org/albatross/albatross
come under a modified BSD license, although it does appear that the gitorious 
fork intended to license new code under the GPL it was never done. The licensing
of Hugo Vincent's fork of the albatross project on Github is questionable, e.g.
the relicensing of the original source, as well as, those modified on the 
albatross project without the original authors consent, but IANAL.

Note, this project is essentially a fork of the albatross project from gitorious
with changes merged in from Hugo Vincent's Github fork; much author attribution
has been put back in place.    

The only files not under the modified BSD license are CoursePoint.cpp and 
CoursePoint.h (in Source/Navigation) which are GPL v3.

	OpenGC Glass Cockpit and Groundstation for the Albatross UAV

_______________________________________________________________________________

	1.	Description
_______________________________________________________________________________

OpenGC is part of the groundstation software for the Albatross UAV project.
OpenGC was originally authored by Damion Shelton for use by flight simulator
enthusiasts in 2001-2004, and has been substantially modified and improved to
suit realtime monitoring of autonomous aircraft from the ground. 

FIXME this description is quite poor.

For more information see the project web sites at:

1) Compile with Scons:
		$ scons -C PlatformSupport/Linux
2) Modify default paths in Data/Preferences.xml and Data/Default.xml
3) Now run it in test mode:
		$ ./PlatformSupport/Linux/build/GlassCockpit -t
   or in flight mode:
		$ ./PlatformSupport/Linux/build/GlassCockpit
   or attach it to a running FlightGear simulator:
		$ ./PlatformSupport/Linux/build/GlassCockpit -slocalhost:5800 # format is host:port
